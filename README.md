# JavaScript Conditonals

In programming, logic is used to make decisions in code. Conditional statements give us the ability to run a piece of code or another depending on the conditional statement.

### Below are exercises to get familiar with conditionals. Remember to invoke your function and pass your arguments. Store the invoked function in a variable and console log the variable name.

**1. GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO**

Create a function called `greaterThanOrEqualTo` with two parameters called `num1` and `num2`. Inside of the function write a conditional statement that checks if `num1` is greater than or equal to `num2`. If true, return `num1 + " is greater than or equal to " + num2`. Otherwise, return `num1 + " is NOT greater than or equal to " + num2`.

**2. MY FAVORITE FOOD**

Create a variable and assign it to your favorite food. Next, create a function called `myFavoriteFood` with one parameter called `favoriteFood`. Inside of the function write a conditional statement that checks if `favoriteFood` equals `"musubi"`. If true, return `Musubi is my favorite food`. Otherwise, return `"Musubi is NOT my favorite. I prefer" + food`

**3. LUCKY NUMBER**

Create a variable and assign it to a number of your choice. Next, create a function called `luckyNumber` with one parameter called `number`. Inside of the function write a conditional statement that checks if `number` equals `99`. If true, return `"That's my lucky number!"`, otherwise return `"That is not my lucky number!"`.

**4. VERIFY AGE**

Create a function called `verifyAge` with one parameter called `age`. Inside of the function write a conditional statment that checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `16`. If true, return `"You are old enough to drive!"`, otherwise return `"You are not old enough to drive"`.

**5. WEEKEND CHECK**
Create a function called `weekendCheck` with one parameter called `dayOfTheWeek`. Inside the function write a conditional statement that checks if `dayOfTheWeek` is equal to `Saturday` or `Sunday`. If true, return `"Ready for the weekend!"`, otherwise return `"Not the weekend yet!"`

**6. EAT TACOS**

Create a function called `eatTacos` with one parameter called `action`. Inside of the function write a conditional statement that checks if `action` equals `eat`. If true, return `"Enjoy your tacos!"`, other return `"No tacos for you"`.

**7. FLIPPED SWITCH**

Create a variable called `isOn` and assign its value to `false`. Next, create a function called `flippedSwitch` with one parameter called `lightsOn`. Inside the function write a conditional statement that checks if `lightsOn` is true. If true, return `"Your light is on"`, otherwise return `"Your light is off"`

**8. IS GRADUATING**

Create three variables called `mathTestScore, scienceTestScore, and englishTestScore` and assign each variable to a number between `60-100`. Next, create a function called `isGraduating` with three parameters called `score1, score2, and score3`. Inside of the function create a variable called `totalScore` and assign it to the sum of `score1, score2, and score3`. Next, write a condition to check if `totalScore` is greater than `180`. If true, return `"You are graduating!"`, otherwise return `"Please see a counselor to retake tests"`

**9. GRADE CHECKER**

Create a variable called `testScore` and assign it a value between `0-100`. Next, create a function called `gradeChecker` that takes in one parameter called `score`. Compare `score` to write the following conditionals:

```
50-59 = return "You got an F, try harder"
60-69 = return "You got a D, not good enough"
70-79 = return "You got a C, I think you can do better"
80-89 = return "You got a B, Not to bad"
90-100 = return "You got an A, Your a rock star"!
other = return "Sorry we don't have a grade for that score "
```
